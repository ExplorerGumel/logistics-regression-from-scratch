# logistics-regression-from-scratch

This repository contains an in-depth implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch, showcasing the step-by-step process without relying on external libraries like Scikit-learn. Understanding the core mechanics of the models we use is crucial, and this implementation provides insights into the inner workings of Logistic Regression, enabling a deeper understanding of its underlying principles.



The implementation process involves the following key steps:

1. **Initializing the Model's Parameters:** Setting the foundation by assigning initial random values to the weights and bias.

2. **Forward Propagation:** Estimating the predicted output using the sigmoid function and the initial parameters.

3. **Backward Propagation:** Calculating gradients and derivatives to determine necessary adjustments for the parameters, optimizing the cost function to minimize disparities between the predicted and actual values.

4. **Updating Parameters:** Adjusting the weights and bias based on the corrections obtained from backward propagation, iterating until the model converges to an optimal solution.

5. **Making Predictions:** Utilizing the refined parameters to predict outcomes for new data points, leveraging the learned relationships between the variables.

All these was intuitively achieved without any external library like Scikit learn
